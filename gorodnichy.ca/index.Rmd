### *Greetings,  Bonjour, Вітаю, День Добрый !* 
<!-- {style="padding-top: 0px;"} -->


I'm a Senior Scientist at the <i>Canada Border Services Agency</i>, 
<!-- and [Adjunct Professor at the University of Ottawa](http://engineering.uottawa.ca/eecs/people/gorodnichy-dmitry), -->
working on the applications of *Artificial Intelligence* and *Data Science* for border control.

<!-- Automated Border Control, Biometrics and Video Analytics. -->

I have Ph.D. in Applied Mathematics and Computer Science, authored over a hundred of scientific papers, made over a dozen of inventions, including the [Nouse®](www.nouse.ca) (Nose as Mouse) Intelligent Vision Interface, which is used by Ontario long-care facilities and featured by the [Canada Science and Technology Museum.](http://collect-connect.cstmcweb.ca/2015/02/community-support-click-nose/).
<!-- featured world-wide and used by Ontario long-care facilities, -->
<!-- organized and chaired a number of conferences in Video Anaytics, Neural Networks and Video Recognition, published by IEEE.  -->

Recently, I've been developing Web Applications that leverage the value of Open Canada data using various open source Data Science and  Machine Learning tools: [iTrack PSES]() and [iTrack Border]().

Apart of Science, I enjoy sports (I am Level 9 gymnast, once a member of the Ukrainian Olympic Reserve and University of Alberta gymnastics varsity teams), compose [music](http://gorodnichy.ca/First-Day-Of-Love.htm) and reinterpret in other languages my favourite
<!-- I express my feelings in songs and bosa-nova interpretations.  -->
<!-- Among other things, I'm Level 9 gymnast, interpret -->
[bosa-nova](http://bookdown.org/gorodnichy/jobim), 



<!-- I am also Adjunct Professor at the <a href="http://engineering.uottawa.ca/eecs/people/gorodnichy-dmitry">University of Ottawa</a> and a co-founder of <a href="http://ivim.ca/">IVIM Inc.</a> - the exclusive provider of <a href="http://www.nouse.ca/">Nouse®</a>, which is the<i> Ontario Ministry of Health and Long-Care</i> recommended mouse alternative technology that I have developed at the National Research Council of Canada. -->
